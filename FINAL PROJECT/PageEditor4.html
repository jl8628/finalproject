      comprehensive content curated by our teams. This button seamlessly directs
      users to explore the depth of our collective efforts. By integrating
      dynamic elements and thoughtful design, the Gallery Page offers an

    <h4>Sitemap</h4>
    <p>
      The sitemap was carefully developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript, supplemented by knowledge gained from lecture notes. Using SVG
      images, each sitemap part has a smooth aesthetic appeal, with dynamic
      colour changes that improve user interaction. The navigation is smooth and
      easy to use because all elements are carefully linked to their respective
      pages and functionality is integrated seamlessly. Additionally, the
      sub-pages that are positioned beneath labelled sections like 'Content' and
      'Page Editor' highlight a careful attention to detail and allow for easier
      access to additional content. This expertly designed sitemap is a perfect
      example of how technical accuracy and design sense can work together
      effectively..
