        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Quality education in primary school</b> is crucial as it forms
            the foundation for lifelong learning and development. During these
            formative years, children acquire fundamental skills such as
            literacy, numeracy, and critical thinking, which are essential for
            success in later stages of education and in life. Additionally,
            quality primary education plays a significant role in shaping
            children's attitudes, behaviors, and social skills, laying the
            groundwork for positive interactions and relationships within their
            communities. By receiving a high-quality education in primary
            school, children are better prepared to navigate future academic
            challenges, pursue their aspirations, and contribute meaningfully to
            society.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Moreover</b>, quality primary education is essential for
            promoting equity and breaking the cycle of poverty. It serves as a
            powerful tool for leveling the playing field and providing all
            children, regardless of their background or circumstances, with
            equal opportunities to succeed. By ensuring that every child has
            access to a quality education from an early age, societies can
            empower individuals to reach their full potential, reduce
            inequalities, and create a more inclusive and prosperous future for
            all.
